      "I had the privilege of meeting Lilan at an international Initiatives of Change forum in Caux , Switzerland last year entitled, “Healing the Wounds of the Past”. Then in December when I visited his country he gave me insight into the Sri Lankan cultural heritage. Midst the acute challenges that Sri Lanka has faced in the past few years he remains resolute in finding very practical ways forward. By nature this goes beyond Sri Lanka to our global challenges of climate change and related issues such as sustainability and food security. He is working at the “coal face” through ensuring cutting edge technologies are made available to those who need them in addressing these matters. \n\nHe has been recognised internationally for his social entrepreneurial success. This has a foundation in his own organisation, ELZIAN AGRO. However, he is tireless in his commitment beyond that space to sharing and learning so that humankind can make a better fist of meeting its current monumental needs. Lilan’s work is encouraging and hope giving, and it was a wonderful opportunity last year to share in that spirit in both Caux and Sri Lanka. His future contribution will enrich many important initiatives to heal and change our globe.",
