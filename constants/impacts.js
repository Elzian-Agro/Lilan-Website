          "Thrilled to have participated in the Climate Entrepreneurship Program at New York University and NYU School of Professional Studies! I explored unique value propositions, innovative business models, and the principles of the lean startup methodology. Unlike traditional approaches, lean startups focus on searching for the right business model, constantly testing, revising, and gathering customer feedback to rapidly iterate and refine products. This approach significantly reduces the risk of launching products that don't meet market needs, ensuring that we build solutions that truly resonate with our customers.",
